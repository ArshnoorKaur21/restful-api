    <!--  here with hlp of post method i have to add new students in api
        for fetchung data that i entered in api write
        console.log(req.body)
        const user=new Student(req.body) req.body means here i am requesting data inside body
        res.send("hello from other side")
        here ab main aise likhu then undefine whow hoga at console.og we wll not get json data here undefined bcz this here data is in pure json format
        so agr mujhe json data cahhie i have to call express.json in order to recognize  incoming  request objedt as json object.it is also called middllware
        in order to reconize incoming data as json data
        
        using async awat we can also do
        app.post("/students",async(req,res)=>{
        try{
          const user=new Student(req.body)
          const createUser=await user.save()
          res.status(201).send(createUser)
        }
        catch(res){
        res.status(400).send(err)
    }
})

    <!-- we use get req to read data -->
    <!-- if i want to get /read data of particular person then then we will use id here-->
    <!-- chahe hm koi bhi curd operation perform kren hmara root hmesha same rehna ie /students in this
    
    /students/:id means in 
     //    when i will write only req.params then i will get {"id": "624e8b8677a42d740750a7d4"}
       //    when i will write only req.params.id then i will get 624e8b8677a42d740750a7d4 only
    //    res.send(_id)
    // in get in postman write localhost:3000/students/624e8b8677a42d740750a7d4-->




    <!-- handle delete request in api -->
